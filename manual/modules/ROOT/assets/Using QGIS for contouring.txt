*Using QGIS for contouring depths from the OpenCPN Survey_pi plugin
*
*Purpose***

**To demonstrate a workflow for creating contour lines for the soundings
obtained from the OpenCPN pluginSurvey_pi.
*
**Requirements**

**QGIS *

This can be downloaded here:

*https://www.qgis.org    (Windows, Linux, MacOS)*

This guide was written using the Windows version.

Not sure if GRASS is necessary but this was the QGIS version used.

Survey_pi holds all the soundings data in an sqlite database. First
check that QGIS can find the data.



Use the 'spatialite' option.




The drop-down shows the tables in your database. I only had one survey
to work with. With more than one survey the workflow may differ



Now we know that the data is available return to the main screen of QGIS.

'Add Layer'
'Add Spatialite Layer'




You see the database connection and can select the 'sounding' table.
Notice the POINTgeometry.





Add the database to your project.





The connection to the data has been established.
'Right-Click' on the 'soundings' layer to save a Shapefile.

'Export'
'Save Features As...'

'Right-Click' again on the Shapefile. 'Zoom to Layer' shows you the
location of the soundings.
This demonstrates the density of soundings required if contouring is
going to be successful. The survey lines are about 10 metres apart.



Now the interesting bit.

Select 'Vector','Contour' from the menu at the top of the screen.



The input is the shapefile of soundings. 'depth' is the data value. If
you go through the list of options and set things up
correctly QGIS will work out min/max depth and you can choose a suitable
contour interval. I needed to play with the number of contours
but eventually a list appeared in the text box. It is possible to apply
colours but probably better to use a single colour.





Magic. The contours appear.



To make the contours display better 'Right-Click'. Black will show the
contours best.









We now add labels to the contours.

'Properties'










The shapefile is in vector format. It has to be converted to raster
before it can be exported as a geotiff.



Raster output is shown. Some of the contours are faded but that will not
affect their display. Unfortunately contour labels disappear. Also the
datum line (0)




Survey_pi uses the coordinate reference system (CRS) EPSG:3395 (metres
east/north). To create a geotiff that can be used in OpenCPN the CRS has
to be set to EPSG:4326 (lat/lon).
Both CRS are WGS 84 projection.

'Right-Click'



Set the CRS to EPSG:4326.



'Right-Click' and 'Export', 'Save as...'
*Very important that 'Rendered image' is used.*



This creates the geotiff of the contour lines.

QGIS displays correctly but initially colours may be reversed when
viewing the geotiff file.



The survey can be displayed on OpenCPN with PhotoLayer_pi and compared
with other charts.

The results for this area were significantly different from official
sources. Recently the author met a
yachtsman who had anchored at Dandy Hole in what was thought to be the
deepest position. The boat grounded at low water!



Geotiffs can only be edited with Microsoft Paint, as far as is known. At
one point editing resulted in the contour lines turning black.
Notes can be added with 'Paint'. Numbers against contour lines do not
seem to be carried through to the geotiff when exporting geotiff
using QGIS. Notice the lack of the datum line (0)






It has not been found possible to export a kap chart from PhotoLayer.
The conversion of GeoTiff to kap can be made with MAPC2MAPC.

*The problem is that the 'official' data is obscured.


*Labelling the contours

*This can be useful for adding labels to contours with *Microsoft
Paint*. The value for each contour is indicated by the sounding around
it or you can use the contour labels from QGIS described earlier.

*'Right-Click' on the soundings file.


For value use 'depth'.

*'Apply'
'OK'
