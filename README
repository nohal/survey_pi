VERSION 3 - MAJOR UPDATE - in the master code only

For OpenCPN v5. Uses svg icons.

Changes

Soundings are saved in point format lon-lat. This affects any soundings saved in the sqlite file, with version 2. To fix this, export the survey to a Hydromagic,xyz or csv
file. Delete the old survey and add a new survey. Import from the saved file into the new survey.

libspatialite-amalgamation cannot be recommended and has been replaced by mod_spatialite. This change was necessary to use the full range of spatialite functions.

The lon-lat point format for the geometry objects can now be used with these functions.

A tidal correction is still in the code but it is not satisfactory. Intention is to replace this with tidal corrections entered in a text file that can be read and used by
the plugin. This will allow separation between raw data and adjusted data.

Using OpenGL the soundings can be viewed without a sounding mark.
Now possible to delete a sounding using right-click.

Windows 
The plugin builds standalone without additional files.

Usage on Windows
Download the file 'mod_spatialite-4.3.0a-win-x86.7z' from http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/windows-bin-x86/. Extract the files. Place all the files EXCEPT 'zlib1.dll' and 'sqlite3.exe' in the main OpenCPN program folder (The folder containing 'opencpn.exe'). Download sqlite3.dll and place in the same folder.
